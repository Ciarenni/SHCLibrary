# SHCLibrary
Library of functionality that was reused in multiple SHC programs.

I got tired of rewriting the same functions over and over, so I looked into how to make a library. This was the result. It has the format for sending commands to the antenna, to the radio, and for communicating over a TCP pipe (which I really only used in one program).
